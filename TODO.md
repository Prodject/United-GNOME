A roadmap/todo file for contributors and anyone curious. Also technically functions as a known issues list.

----------
# Shell
- Gradient effect on top bar in 17.10

# GTK2/3
- Tiled window borders
- Backdrop state differentiation

# Login theme
- The styling for the login dialog is untested but how to go about testing it without doing the whole compile into a gresource file isn't clear. I'm not sure how it happened to begin with, but on UG 17.04, a theme's login styling worked for the logged in user's lock screen but I can't seem to get that behavior working again.

# Epiphany Incognito Mode
- Right now it follows Adwaita's styling, but customizing it doesn't _seem_ to be possible.
